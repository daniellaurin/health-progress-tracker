## üçΩÔ∏è Diet Philosophy

This is a personalized diet that I'm still currently modifying. Current cutting progress is intermediate to slow as my caloric restriction is inconsistent. I no longer thoroughly calorie track with a strict -500 deficit as I found it too hard to sustain, almost funneling into a diet that requires meal prepping every meal, which doesn't fit my lifestyle. I no longer track macro and micronutrients in detail.

My previous macro split when tracking was approximately:

- 25% protein
- 45% fat
- 30% carbs

This made more of my diet calories come from fat sources, similar to a ketogenic approach (obviously never reaching ketosis). Currently, my macros are likely different with more focus on carbohydrate sources. These macros reflected dietary preferences rather than the most optimal nutritional ratio.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Weight Loss Philosophy

I apply the _1% body weight rule_, where I should on weekly average lose 1% of bodyweight as an intermediate to aggressive weight loss goal. This approach is more effective for higher BMI cutting goals as greater weight fluctuations occur at higher body fat ratios.

For example:

- 275lb √ó 0.01 = 2.75lb per week
- 1lb of fat = 3500kcal
- 2.75lb √ó 3500kcal = 9625kcal
- 9625kcal √∑ 7 days = -1,375kcal daily deficit

This is a much more aggressive diet compared to the standard -500kcal cut. This rough calorie deficit accounts for water weight held by glycogen (the main reason for rapid initial weight loss). The 1% rule factors in both water weight and potential muscle atrophy.

As this is a more aggressive approach to dieting, there are several challenges. Hunger pains and going to bed hungry are somewhat common occurrences. Additionally, some atrophy of muscle and strength is experienced due to the limited potential for recomposition.

### Deficit Mentality

- **Little to no calorie tracking:** Likely why progress is slower than preferred
- **Portion controlled:** Portions are still measured in grams and accounted for, especially for condiments
- **Intermittent fasting:** Though not ideal for reducing brain fog, it helps significantly with satiety and reduces midnight cravings when willpower is lower
- **Eating window:** 12pm-9pm (12pm for intermittent fasting; found willpower drops drastically after 9pm and portion control becomes less disciplined)
- **No drinking calories:** Avoids juices, full-sugar sodas, and alcohol (social drinking in moderation is acceptable and factored into caloric intake)
- **Volume eating:** To increase satiety, considering food volume as a factor (vegetables tend to be more filling as they occupy more volume in your stomach)
- **Satiety index:** Useful metric showing some foods are more filling than others (e.g., feeling fuller eating a steak than consuming the same calories in almonds)

### Implemented Diet Strategies

- **Diet Soda:** Easy way to satisfy sweet cravings without calories; carbonation helps with satiety when eating
- **Sugar-Free Gum:** Helps with satiety after 9pm (caution with sugar-free gum as ingredients like sorbitol can have laxative effects)
- **Earlier sleeping schedule:** During low willpower times (end-of-day), going to bed early helps avoid overeating urges
- **Water intake:** Water is excellent for volume (as are carbonated beverages); flavor packets can help increase intake
- **Sugar-free jello:** When water doesn't satisfy volume needs, jello is effective for managing hunger pains; keeping a bowl on standby improves diet consistency

## üìç Custom Gym Regiment

Over the years I've created a custom gym regiment with my favorite exercises with 3 day split with rest, focusing more on the compound main movements as my splits. These workouts take around 60min to complete. I do time my rest times to 2min, not for training purposes but, for workout completion time. I prefer near to failure mentality (one rep in the chamber). Mostly for shorter rest time between sets and practice a more volume mindset when it comes to exercise (not having multiple weekday restdays).

### Synopsis Training Philosophy

- **Split:** 3-day routine with rest days
- **Focus:** Compound movements as primary exercises
- **Duration:** ~60 minutes per session
- **Rest Times:** 2 minutes between sets (timed for workout efficiency)
- **Intensity:** Near failure mentality ("one rep in the chamber")
- **Volume Focus:** Prioritizing higher volume with fewer rest days
