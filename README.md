# Diet Philosophy

This is a personalized diet that I'm still currently working on. Current cutting progress is intermedediate to slow. As my current caloric restriction is inconsistent.
As I don't thorouly calory track anymore (-500 defecit) as I found it more diet restricting almost funneling into a diet that composes meal prepping every meal, which is not ideal for my lifestyle. I do not track macro and micronutrients anymore.

My Previous Macro split when I tracked was on the lines
30% protein
40% fat
30% carbs

Making it, more of my diet calories coming from fat sources, more on the lines on a keto-genic diet (obviously never reaching ketosis though). Though I beleive currently my macros definelty different

Those Macros were more diatary prefences then
the most optimal macro ratio

# Custom Gym Regiment Progress Tracker

Over the years I've created a custom gym regiment with my favorite exercises with 3 day split with rest, focusing more on the compound main
movements as my splits. These workouts take around 60min to complete. I do time my rest times to 2min, not for training purposes but, for workout completion time.
I prefer near to failure to mentality (one rep in the chambre). Mostly for shorter rest time between sets and practice a more volume mindset
when it comes to exercise (not having multiple weekday restdays)

## Synopsis Training Philosophy

- **Split:** 3-day routine with rest days
- **Focus:** Compound movements as primary exercises
- **Duration:** ~60 minutes per session
- **Rest Times:** 2 minutes between sets (timed for workout efficiency)
- **Intensity:** Near failure mentality ("one rep in the chamber")
- **Volume Focus:** Prioritizing higher volume with fewer rest days
